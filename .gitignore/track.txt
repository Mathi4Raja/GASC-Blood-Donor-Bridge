Short answer: Partially — yes for donors, and partially for requestors.

Donors: when a request is created the system calls [config/notifications.php](c:\Program Files\XAMPP\htdocs\GASC-Blood-Donor-Bridge\config\notifications.php)::notifyDonorsForBloodRequest and eligible donors receive email notifications using functions in [config/email.php](c:\Program Files\XAMPP\htdocs\GASC-Blood-Donor-Bridge\config\email.php). See the call and logging in [request/blood-request.php](c:\Program Files\XAMPP\htdocs\GASC-Blood-Donor-Bridge\request\blood-request.php).

Requestors:

On submission the requestor receives a confirmation email that includes the number of currently available donors (see the sendEmail call in [request/blood-request.php](c:\Program Files\XAMPP\htdocs\GASC-Blood-Donor-Bridge\request\blood-request.php)).
The requestor also receives status-update emails when admins change the request status (see the email sending in [admin/requests.php](c:\Program Files\XAMPP\htdocs\GASC-Blood-Donor-Bridge\admin\requests.php) and notifyRequestorStatusUpdate in [config/notifications.php](c:\Program Files\XAMPP\htdocs\GASC-Blood-Donor-Bridge\config\notifications.php)).
What is not implemented:

There is no automatic follow-up notification to the requestor when new matching donors become available after the request was created. The system does not push incremental "new donor found" emails unless you add that logic.


Currently there is no explicit inactivity logout enforced in the code. Summary:

The code regenerates the session ID every 30 minutes (uses $_SESSION['created'] and 1800 seconds) but does not destroy the session after inactivity.
Session cookie has no explicit lifetime in code (so it's a browser-session cookie — it expires when the browser closes).
Server-side session data lifetime depends on PHP's session.gc_maxlifetime (default 1440 seconds = 24 minutes) in php.ini — meaning inactive session files may be garbage-collected by PHP according to that setting.
Notes:

After this change, protected pages should call startSecureSession() and, if it returns false, redirect to login with an “session expired” message.
Adjust $inactivityTimeout to your desired inactivity period.
Also consider aligning php.ini session.gc_maxlifetime with your timeout to avoid orphaned server-side session files.

/**
 * DEPRECATED: This file has been replaced with secure, role-specific password reset pages
 * 
 * For security reasons, this shared password reset functionality has been replaced with:
 * - /donor/forgot-password.php (for donors)
 * - /admin/forgot-password.php (for admins/moderators)
 * 
 * This redirect ensures old links still work while directing users to secure pages.
